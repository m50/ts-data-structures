# Data Structures [TS]

![Node](https://github.com/m50/ts-data-structures/workflows/Node/badge.svg)

This is just a learning exercise for me, implementing common data structures in
TypeScript as I learn them.

As I go along, I may recreate these same data structures in other languages
as well, as a process for learning other languages. This gives me a consistent
project outline for creating consistent structures.

I figured I'd start with a strictly typed language that I am familiar with.
